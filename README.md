# xGREP
Simple Python program that allow users to search inside multiple files. xGREP supports many file formats, basically everything that's txt based (like *.txt, .log, .yaml* and etc.)

Search for something (string). xGREP will search for the given string inside all the files in the selected folder/path 
or selected files. Select files/folder & the program will search for the string in them. If nothing's selected - 
defaults apply.

Example:
 -  Valid path example: C:/Users/admin/Desktop.
 -  Valid file type: *file_type* / *.file_type*
 -  (File name: *test.txt*) - (Line no: 1, Index: 21) - (Full line: test 123)
 
 You can always enter [-e] or [-E] to exit.
 
 Work in xGREP is similar to Linux.
