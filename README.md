# xGREP - Search Tool for Text-based Files
xGREP allow users to search for a specific string inside multiple text-based files, such as .txt, .log, .yaml, and more. The program can be executed from the command line and is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

### How to use:
To use xGREP, simply provide a file path or a folder that contains the files you want to search in. The program will then search for the specified string inside all the files in the selected directory. If nothing's selected - defaults apply. Written from developer's POV.

The search results will show the file name, line number, and index of the matched string, along with the full line that contains the search string.

### Example:
 -  Valid path example: C:/Users/admin/Desktop.
 -  Valid file type: *<file_type>* / *.<file_type>*
 -  Structure: (File name: *test.txt*) - (Line no: 1, Index: 21) - (Full line: test 123)
 
You can also use the -e or -E option to exit the program.
 
xGREP is inspired by Linux's grep command and follows a similar working pattern.
